# ELMC01Sessions
This repository is going to store the code developed during our Review Sessions for Cycle-01.

The frameworks located in this repository:
- Banking Framework
- Phone Framework

Latest updates to REAME per `git commit --amend`

I'm making changes to the COPY of my
original README file in Git Repository.
And this copy is stored in Working Tree.
